# Minimal operator runtime pieces: ServiceAccount, Deployment, webhook Service, RBAC.
# These are currently sourced from the upstream deploy/operator manifests but should be
# trimmed to only the necessary runtime resources. The full deploy/operator tree remains
# in `operator/upstream` for reference but ArgoCD will now point at this runtime dir.
