# For talos_install role: hosts are VPS in rescue mode (SSH accessible).
# For talos_bootstrap + cilium: talosctl runs locally (talosctl_delegate_to: localhost).

# The rescue_mode group is used only during initial Talos installation.
# After install, all talosctl/kubectl/helm commands run locally against public IPs.
